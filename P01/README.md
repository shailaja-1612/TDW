# YouTube Views Forecasting

This project predicts daily YouTube video views using historical data like views, likes, comments, watch time, and subscriber changes. It helps content creators plan publishing strategies and understand video performance trends. Python scripts in `src/` generate forecasts and plots, which are saved in `outputs/`. Install dependencies via `requirements.txt` and run `src/ml/forecast_views.py` to generate forecasts.
